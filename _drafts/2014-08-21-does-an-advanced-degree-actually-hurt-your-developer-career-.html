<p>This was an interesting question that came up in a discussion I've had recently with a group of undergrad computer science students. Basically, the notion they've heard was that not only would a Master's or Ph.D. degree be mostly useless for becoming a good software developer - it would actually cause *damage* to your career. The question was whether I thought this was true. My immediate response was "no", adding the caveat that the additional skills acquired in grad school might indeed.</p>
