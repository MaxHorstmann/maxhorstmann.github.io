Hi, I'm Max. I'm a software developer.

Occasionally, I share my thoughts on programming, technology, startups, and career right here on my blog.

I live in New York City and work at [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

Have a look at my [reading list](/reading).

If you would like to send me a note, I'm [Max_Horstmann](https://twitter.com/Max_Horstmann) on Twitter.
