<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: A few additions at the end. I was pretty surprised (and so was my WP server) that that this made HN front-page. Also - hello, <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">When ordering an <a href="http://uber.com/invite/s8462">Uber </a>ride, I (obviously) have to enter my pickup location.</span></p>
<p>Can I please also enter the intended <em>dropoff location</em>? Maybe like this:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-443 alignnone" alt="set_dropoff" src="/images/set_dropoff.png" width="389" height="691" /></p>
<p>Or, maybe even better: let me enter it <em>after</em> the pick-up has been confirmed, while waiting for the driver. And, while we're at it: let me also pick a preferred route, if I want to.</p>
<p>Why? Because that way, the driver will already have directions pre-loaded in their GPS when they pick me up. Makes is easier for both of us, and the whole experience becomes even smoother.</p>
<p>And, it will prevent this from happening again:</p>
<p><a href="http://maxhorstmann.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gotLost.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-445" alt="gotLost" src="/images/gotLost.png" width="339" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>That was earlier this year. Here's what happend: the Uber app, which uses Google Maps, was able to find my destination address - I know this because I requested a fare quote. However, the driver used a <em>different</em> GPS for navigation, which did <em>not</em> find it. And the driver was unfamiliar with the neighborhood (and so was I).</p>
<p>This could have been avoided if the driver's GPS would have been pre-loaded with directions.</p>
<p>By the way - why do drivers have to use the Uber driver app <em>and</em> a separate navigation device anyways? Add navigation capabilities to the app, and the drivers can ditch their GPS devices. And will also be less distracted while driving.</p>
<p>Sounds good? Great, let me know when it's done. Oh, and thanks for the free black car upgrade yesterday. Keep up the good work!</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7583958">Discuss on HN.</a></p>
<p>UPDATE: some interesting comments on HN, here are my responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk of drivers rejecting rides based on drop-off location (pointed out by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584147">tptacek</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584154">apaprocki</a> and others): that's a valid concern, but as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584166">jaredsohn</a> points out correctly, this can easily be mitigated by hiding this information from the driver until they actually pick up the passenger.</li>
<li>Drivers using their smartphones for navigation could be less safe than dash-mounted nav devices (also pointed out by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584147">tptacek</a>): true, drivers would have to be required to dash-mount their smartphones in a similarly fashion. This setup would certainly be much safer than the current one, where they're paying attention to a mounted GPS <em>and</em> their non-mounted smartphone running the Uber app.<br />
Also - maybe at some point in the future, the Uber driver's app can run directly on the car's on-board computer system - now that would be nice, wouldn't it?</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584194">dsl</a> points out that "If you request a fare quote before your request, the driver will see your destination once they have accepted the fare" - now that is interesting! I'd suggest to make this more prominent to the user, and also add route selection (for the passenger) and gps integration (for the driver).</li>
</ul>
