Subject: Your blog post on partially compiled algorithms

Hi Max,

We saw your blog post on partially compiled algorithms on Hacker News today and really enjoyed reading it. In particular the performance improvements you achieved by switching to alpha/beta queues in your optimizer look very impressive.

We're a a small engineering team here at Dronebotify. In case you haven't heard of us, we're building bots to automatically schedule drone deliveries to cruise ships. We're using  algorithms to generate collision-free delivery schedules, and some of the ideas in your blog post could possibly be useful for us.

Would you be interested in 

Joe
