Subject: Your blog post on partially compiled algorithms

>Hi Max,

>We have a small engineering team here at Dronebotify, we're building bots to automatically schedule drone deliveries to cruise ships.

We were pretty excited about your blog post on Hacker News today, in particular about the delivery time improvements 
you saw when switching to alpha/beta queues in your optimizer. 

Would you be interested in chatting with us? We'd love to get to know you.

Cheers,
Joe
