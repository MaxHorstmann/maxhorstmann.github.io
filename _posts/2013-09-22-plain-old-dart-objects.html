<p>As a C# developer, I use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx">auto-implemented properties</a> all the time, typically to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object">POCOs</a>:</p>
{% highlight C# %} 
{% raw %}
class Customer
{
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string City { get; set; }
  public DateTime Created { get; set; }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The compiler will generate an invisible (well, sort of) private member field for each property, which can only be accessed through the getters and setters. Why is it a good practice not just make the member field public, by the way? Because we might wanna add some validation logic later, and changing it from a member field to a property will require recompilation on the caller side. Which is in particular inconvenient if the binaries have been shipped. Also, subclasses can override properties and add logic to them - in C#, it's not possible to override a member field with a property.</p>
<p>Now, let's write the POCO in Dart (which I guess makes it a <em>PODO</em>):</p>
<pre>class Customer
{
  String FirstName;
  String LastName;
  String City;
  DateTime Created;
}</pre>
<p>As simple as it gets. One thing you'll notice is that there is no <em>public</em> access modifier. That's because in Dart, <em>there are no access modifiers</em>: if a member attribute starts with an underscore, it's private (to its library). Otherwise, it's public. I think that's great! Typically, programmers use the underscore notation (or a similar prefix such as m_) by convention anyways. So, having an access modified <em>and</em> the prefix is kind of redundant.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">Also, unlike in the C# version, nothing appears to tell the compiler to wrap those attributes in auto-generated getters and setters. That's because the Dart compiler </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">always</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;"> implicitly generates them (except for setters on </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">final</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;"> attributes)! Well, as an optimization, it might not </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">really</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;"> do that although the Dart documentation </span><a style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;" href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html#classes-getters-and-setters">does make that claim</a><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">. But the important part is that you can pretend that it does, and if you should choose to make the getters/setters explicit later (or override them in a subclass), you have a guarantee that nothing will break. For instance, here's how we might add some validation logic later and/or in a subclass:</span></p>
<pre> String _firstName;
 String <strong>get</strong> FirstName 
 {
   return _firstName;
 }

 <strong>set</strong> FirstName(String value)
 {
   if (value == "Dirk") throw new Exception("No Dirks allowed here.");
   _firstName = value; 
 }</pre>
<p>There's one more thing: frequently, you're going to instantiate all the member fields of a POxO at instantiation. Here's how Dart allows you to define a constructor for just that:</p>
<pre>Customer(this.FirstName, this.LastName, this.City, this.Created);</pre>
<p>Hmm... syntactic sugar, sweet!</p>
