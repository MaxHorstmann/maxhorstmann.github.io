Earlier this year, I wrote a piece for the Stack Overflow Blog, slightly clickbait-y titled [Why you should build on Kubernetes from day one](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/21/why-you-should-build-on-kubernetes-from-day-one/).

I also had a chance to discuss it with [Ben](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/benpopper/) and [Ryan](https://stackoverflow.blog/author/rdonovan) on the [Stack Overflow podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/27/podcast-361-why-startups-should-use-kubernetes-from-day-one/).
