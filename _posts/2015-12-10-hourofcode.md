Yesterday, I had the amazing privilege to volunteer and help bringing this year's [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) to [Dr. Susan S McKinney Secondary School of the Arts](http://www.mckinneyssa.com/) in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. This is me, wearing my nerdy Stack Overflow gear, going over the [Minecraft tutorial](http://hourofcode.com/mc) in front of a class of 7th graders:

It was fantastic to see how excited those kids were to learn how to code! The folks at [code.org](http://code.org) did a great job  putting together a set of fun tutorials which make it really easy to get started with basic coding concepts. In fact, I could literally watch some of the students grasping the idea of a loop right in front of my eyes. 

Unfortunately, this will have been the only day during the whole school year the great students at McKinney school will have gotten  exposure to any kind of formal computer science education. Like many schools in rather underprivileged neighborhoods, McKinney currently has neither the funding nor the equipment for teaching CS on a regular basis. [Computer Science For All](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/education-vision-2015-computer-science.page), Mayor Bill de Blasio's initiative to "give every public school student access to computer science education within the next 10 years", hasn't trickled down to this particular school yet. And the teachers I've spoked to weren't particular optimistic that it would happen any time soon. "Schools like us just get lost in the shuffle", as one of them expressed it.

So, while it was certainly worth getting McKinney's students excited about programming and encouraging them to look into it more at home (and some of them promised they will), it was almost depressing to see the public school system failing them at the same time. There were a lot of very smart, talented kids in those class rooms; they got the basic concepts, finished the tutorials quickly, and were eager to learn more. Unfortunately, without more frequent encouragement, I'm afraid chances are that not very many of them will find their way to a technical career. 

Initiatives such as Computer Science For All shouldn't take 10 years to implement.
