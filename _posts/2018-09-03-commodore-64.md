The Commodore 64 (my first real computer) was released in 1982, so basically in the bronze age of computing. It's far from dead though: more than 35 years later, there's still an large active community out there, even developing new games and apps for it. A while back, I [asked a Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22284128) about a Commodore Basic quirk which has always bothered me as a teenager, and of course I got an answer.

For example, listen to the tune of [Gyroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope_(video_game)) for a minute:

And now check out the 2006 remix version by Graham Jarvis and Rob Hartshorne:
