The Commodore 64 (my first real computer) was released in 1982, so basically in the bronze age of computing. It's far from dead though: more than 35 years later, there's still an large active community out there, even developing new games and apps for it. A while back, I [asked a Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22284128) about a Commodore Basic quirk which has always bothered me as a teenager, and of course I got an answer.

I'm in particular amazed by the creativity of the C64 music remix community. You'll find them on sites such as [remix64.com](http://www.remix64.com).

For example, listen to the tune of [Gyroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope_(video_game)) for a minute:

And now check out the [2006 remix version](http://www.remix64.com/track/chronberg/gyroscope-unzalicious-version) by Graham Jarvis and Rob Hartshorne:

<source src="http://remix.kwed.org/download.php/3151/Chronblom%20-%20Gyroscope%20-%20Unzalicious%20version.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>


Or, one more: listen in to the ending tune of "Space Harrier"...

And now check out [Patholog](http://www.remix64.com/act/patholog/)'s remix [Space Harrier 2010](http://www.remix64.com/track/patholog/space-harrier-2010):

<audio style="width:100%; display: block;" controls="" controlslist="nodownload">
<source src="http://remix.kwed.org/download.php/4537/Patholog%20-%20Space%20Harrier%202010.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

Amazing!
