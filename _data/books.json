Long regarded as one of the first books to pioneer a people-oriented approach to computing, The Psychology of Computer Programming endures as a penetrating analysis of the intelligence, skill, teamwork, and problem-solving power of the computer programmer. Finding the chapters strikingly relevant to today's issues in programming, Gerald M. Weinberg adds new insights and highlights the similarities and differences between now and then. Using a conversational style that invites the reader to join him, Weinberg reunites with some of his most insightful writings on the human side of software engineering. Topics include egoless programming, intelligence, psychological measurement, personality factors, motivation, training, social problems on large projects, problem-solving ability, programming language design, team formation, the programming environment, and much more.

Kerth guides readers through productive, empowering retrospectives of project performance. Whether your shop calls them postmortems or postpartums or something else, project retrospectives offer organizations a formal method for preserving the valuable lessons learned from the successes and failures of every project. These lessons and the changes identified by the community will foster stronger teams and savings on subsequent efforts. For a retrospective to be effective and successful, though, it needs to be safe. Kerth shows facilitators and participants how to defeat the fear of retribution and establish an air of mutual trust. One tool is Kerth's Prime Directive: Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. Applying years of experience as a project retrospective facilitator for software organizations, Kerth reveals his secrets for managing the sensitive, often emotionally charged issues that arise as teams relive and learn from each project. Don't move on to your next project without consulting and using this readable, practical handbook. Each member of your team will be better prepared for the next deadline.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"UCSD:31822029981735"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":268,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4.0,"ratingsCount":3,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780932633422&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:9780932633422&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Project_retrospectives.html?hl=&id=BxROAQAAIAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=BxROAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Don&#39;t move on to your next project without consulting and using this readable, practical handbook.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction.

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time. The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper \"No Silver Bullet\"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, \"There will be no silver bullet within ten years.\"","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132119160"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0132119161"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4.0,"ratingsCount":5,"contentVersion":"0.6.1.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0201835959&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&dq=isbn:0201835959&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mythical_Man_Month_Anniversary_Editi.html?hl=&id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":34.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":19.24,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&dq=isbn:0201835959&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":34990000.0,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":19240000.0,"currencyCode":"USD"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Mythical_Man_Month_Anniversary_Editi-sample-epub.acsm?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Mythical_Man_Month_Anniversary_Editi-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Yq35BY5Fk3gC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"fUYPAQAAMAAJ","etag":"v1Rs7BX5clY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fUYPAQAAMAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Mythical Man-month","subtitle":"Essays on Software Engineering","authors":["Frederick Phillips Brooks"],"publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publishedDate":"1995-01","description":"No book on software project management has been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month.
